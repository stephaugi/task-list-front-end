# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
We do not have any particular accessibility needs.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Stephanie: We can liveshare and code together during activity sessions. Communicate what work we are doing separately at the end of sessions.
Helen: Work together when time allows, and divide tasks for individual work when needed. Communicate through Slack.
## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Stephanie: I learn best from doing and reviewing code. When prompted to learn something new, I do research to figure out how to do it.
Helen: I learn best by doing, seeing examples, and talking through problems.
## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Stephanie: I prefer code review where we look over code together and discuss which method works better. Communicating what direction we're going in.
Helen: Kind, respectful, and constructive feedback.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Stephanie: Communication and making time to work together.
Helen: Speaking up sooner when I’m stuck or unsure.


## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
